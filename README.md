# MasterProject

+ Untitled.ipynb is SAM and perspective transformation.

+ AAA.ipynb is SAM model.

+ Scripts including perspective transformation, HSV color space, measure the length and width of objects.

     Step 1: HSV color space to find out the optimal values to get the contours of the object ( making the corners as clearly as you can)
     Step 2: Input the the value on perspective transformation script and object_detection scripts (using to extract the contours of the object)
     Step 3: Runing the calculate scripts
